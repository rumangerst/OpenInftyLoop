OpenInftyLoop is a small puzzle game I ported to PC (Windows/Mac/Linux)  from games that are unfortunately
exclusive to mobile platforms.
Just install the program, start it to play.

The goal of each level is to complete the curves on the map by clicking on them.

# Features

* Multiple independent modes such as a campaign or specific field sizes
* Saves yet-to-complete puzzles automatically
* OpenSource: If you want, you can review the game for your own projects or build upon it

# Credits

This game uses the [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org/) version 3.
This game uses sound effects created by *Lokif* obtained from https://opengameart.org/content/gui-sound-effects
and the "Xylophone A" effect created by *DANMITCH3LL* obtained from https://freesound.org/people/DANMITCH3LL/sounds/232004/.
